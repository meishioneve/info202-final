INFO 202 Playground

An interactive mini-website built for the INFO 202 final project.
It’s meant to make some of the more abstract course concepts feel a bit more like a game than a reading list.

What is this?
INFO 202 Playground is a small study tool for reviewing concepts from weeks 1–6 of INFO 202.
It has three main modes:

Quiz Mode – Kahoot-style multiple choice questions with instant feedback
Concept Cards & Audio – short explanations plus podcast-style audio snippets
Interactive Demos – small experiments that visualize things like prototype theory and hierarchical vs. faceted categories

The goal isn’t to cover the entire course, but to show how information organization ideas can be turned into playful, hands-on interactions.

Concepts Covered
- Information as Thing
- Controlled vocabularies & the vocabulary problem
- Prototype theory & typicality
- Hierarchical vs. faceted categories
- Basic metadata / schema thinking

Tech Stack
Very lightweight:
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Designed in Figma, then implemented by hand + with help from Cursor (AI coding assistant)
- Audio explanations generated from my notes using NotebookLM, then embedded as standard audio files
