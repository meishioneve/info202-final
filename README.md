# INFO 202 Playground

An interactive mini-website built for the INFO 202 final project.
It’s meant to make some of the more abstract course concepts feel a bit more like a game than a reading list.

## What is this?

INFO 202 Playground is a small study tool for reviewing concepts from weeks 1–6 of INFO 202.
It has three main modes:
- Quiz Mode – Kahoot-style multiple choice questions with instant feedback
- Concept Cards & Audio – short explanations plus podcast-style audio snippets
- Interactive Demos – small experiments that visualize things like prototype theory and hierarchical vs. faceted categories

The goal isn’t to cover the entire course, but to show how information organization ideas can be turned into playful, hands-on interactions.

## Concepts Covered
- Information as Thing
- Controlled vocabularies & the vocabulary problem
- Prototype theory & typicality
- Hierarchical vs. faceted categories
- Basic metadata / schema thinking

## Tech Stack
Very lightweight:
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Designed in Figma, then implemented by hand + with help from Cursor (AI coding assistant)
- Audio explanations generated from my notes using NotebookLM, then embedded as standard audio files

## AI Use & Limitations
- Cursor was used to refactor and style parts of the HTML/CSS/JS based on Figma designs.
- NotebookLM was used to generate conversational audio from my own written notes.
- All AI outputs were reviewed, edited, and debugged by me, and the final site is still fairly small and hand-tuned.

This is a course project, not a production app, so expect some rough edges.

## Future Directions

In the future, this could evolve into a more general study platform where students upload their own course materials (slides, readings, recordings) and the app automatically generates multiple study modes — quizzes, audio, and interactive demos — on top of that content, especially for theory-heavy or liberal-arts classes.
